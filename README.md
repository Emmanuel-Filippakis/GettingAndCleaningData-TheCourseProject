The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

Submited in the Repo: 
1) a README.md. 

2) the script run_analysis.R which results a tidy data set as described in Sector A.

3) The AveragesDataOutput.txt that Contents the Tidy Data set created in step 5 of the instructions of Sector A.

4) a Code Book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. 

A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

 Sector A. The run_analysis.R script was created in Rstudio (Version 0.98.1103) and does the following.
 
    1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    
    2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    
    3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
    
    4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    
    5.From the data set in step 4, 
    creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
